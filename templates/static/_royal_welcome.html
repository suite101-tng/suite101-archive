	<p>Running a business can be expensive. Aside from salaries and benefits, we have costs that span hosting and security, software licensing, rent, insurance, lawyers, internet connections, conferences, meetups, field trips.</p>
	<p>In order to sustainably pay for ourselves, and to grow the business only ethically, with our community in stride, Suite couples advertising revenue with a royalties program that actually gives away most of what we earn to contributors.</p>
	<p>We distribute 70% of Suite's revenue to participating members in the form of royalties. Members' individual share is determined by their proportion of Suite's overall readership.</p>
